# Bootstrap projects

This repository contains the projects developed from the Udemy course [Learn Bootstrap Development By Building 10 Projects](https://www.udemy.com/learn-bootstrap-development-by-building-10-projects/learn/v4/overview)

I have improved and adapted several things in most of the projects
